# check_primo_pipes
A plugin for Nagios (and other compatible monitoring services) to monitor the status of pipes in the Ex Libris Primo library discovery system. It will alert you in case of pipes ending up in the following states: stopped error, stopped harvest error, and threshold exceeded error. The alerts are cleared by terminating the pipes in question.

The plugin also features a rudimentary support for identifying stalled pipes. This can be monitored if you provide an expected maximum time (a threshold in hours), any pipe would be expected to be in a running state and therefore not to be considered stalled. As soon as the threshold is exceeded, an alert is issued.

Furthermore, you are able to provide a list of scheduled tasks, which should be enabled at any time. If one of the listed tasks is disabled either by you or automatically by the system an alert is issued.

## About
As Ex Libris Primo does not provide users with an API to the back office this plugin can monitor pipes using "screen scraping" via the HTML.

The plugin can monitor all available pipes in one go or a just a single pipe at a time. It supports a compact status output or a more detailed list of the current state of the different pipes.

The plugin will require user credentials for the Primo back office and it is recommend that you create a user specifically for monitoring purposes. A user with the role "Admin" is needed (prior to April 2015 release the role of "Staff User" was adequate due to an error it seems). In addition, the server performing the monitoring will need to have access to the back office URL through the firewall of the Primo server.

## Installation

Copy the check_primo_pipes file to your Nagios plugins directory, e.g.:

    git clone https://github.com/aalborgunilib/check_primo_pipes
    cd check_primo_pipes
    sudo cp plugins/check_primo_pipes /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_primo_pipes

Install Perl dependencies for the plugin via e.g. [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus). (Please stay within the check_primo_pipes directory):

    cpanm --sudo --installdeps .

Now, check to see if the plugin is working:

    plugins/check_primo_pipes -H <http://server.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1701> -i <customerid> -u <username> -p <password>

You should get something in the line of:

    PRIMO_PIPES OK - status 'completed': 14, status 'terminated': 2
    
Or maybe (if something is wrong):

    PRIMO_PIPES CRITICAL - status 'completed': 14, status 'stopped harvest error': 1, status 'terminated': 1

## Usage

    Usage: check_primo_pipes
        [ -H|--hostname=<Primo back office URL> ]
        [ -i|--customerid=<customer id> ]
        [ -u|--username=<user name> ]
        [ -p|--password=<password> ]
        [ -n|--pipe=<pipe name>]
        [ -T|--hours=<max number of hours> ]
        [ -s|--scheduled=<list of pipes> ]
        [ -j|--cookiejar=<filename> ]
        [ -t|--timeout=<timeout> ]
        [ -v|--verbose ]

### Required plugin options

`-H|--hostname` is the url to the Primo BO server (including http:// or https://). Remember to include the port number (Ex Libris usually defaults to 1601).

`-i|--customerid` is a unique number that needs to be extracted from the HTML source code of the login screen to the Primo back office. Look for `<input type="hidden" value="1234567890" name="customerId" />` and take the number from the value attribute.

`-u|--username` and `-p|--password` are your login credentials to the back office.

### Check specific plugin options

If all of the above, required options are set, the plugin will default to check of all defined pipes. If a pipe is in one of the following states: stopped error, stopped harvest error, and threshold exceeded error and the pipe has not been terminated by admin a CRITICAL error will be issued.

`-n|--pipe` is the name of a single pipe that will be checked. By using this option, the plugin can check one pipe at a time. If omitted all pipes will be checked.

`-T|--hours` can be used if you would like to check for stalled pipes. It should be set to the value of the maximum number of hours any pipe should be expected to complete in. If the threshold is exceed a WARNING is issued. If the option is omitted detection for stalled pipes is disabled.

As an example: if the most time consuming of your scheduled pipes usually completes in 2 hours you should probably set the value to 3.

`-s|--scheduled` is a comma separated list of pipe names that should always be enabled in the scheduled tasks list. If one of the listed pipes is disabled (either by admin or a by pipe not being able to run) a WARNING is issued. If omitted detection for scheduled tasks is disabled.

### Miscellaneous plugin options

`-j|--cookiejar` is the filename (including path) where session cookies will be stored. It defaults to `/tmp/check_primo_pipes_cookiejar.dat`.

`-t|--timeout` is the plugin timeout. If timeout is reached, the check will bail out and issue an UNKNOWN state.

`-v|--verbose` will switch to the more detailed status view.

## Todo or future ideas

* Make stalled pipe detection more sophisticated
* Make it possible to define a list of pipes to include / exclude from monitoring
* Monitor the execution time of pipes (performance data)
* Monitor errors in a pipe run
